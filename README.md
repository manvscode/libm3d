### If you want to build the float version:
* autoreconf -i
* ./configure
* make
* make install

### If you want to build the double version:
* autoreconf -i
* ./configure --enable-use-double
* make
* make install

### If you want to build the long double version:
* autoreconf -i
* ./configure --enable-use-long-double
* make
